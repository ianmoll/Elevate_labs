PROJECT STORY
On Day 2 of my Power BI practice journey, I created a dashboard based on a Superstore Sales dataset. The goal was to explore sales performance across various regions, categories, and customer segments, and to gain meaningful insights into how discounting affects profit.
The visualizations I created included:
- KPI CARDS shows QUANTITY, TOTAL PROFIT, TOTAL SALES along with LINE CHART.
- FILLED MAP shows SALES BY STATE.
- Different BAR CHART for TOP CUSTOMERS BY SALES, SUM OF SALES BY SHOPPING TIME, NO OF ORDERS BY SHIP MODE.
- DONUT CHART shows TOTAL SALES AND PROFIT BY CATEGORY.
- COLUMN CHART shows SUM OF PROFIT BY REGION.


  KEY INSIGHTS
  - The Technology category generated high sales but also had inconsistent 
    profit margins.
  - Western and Central regions were the top contributors to total sales.
