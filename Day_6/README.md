## üîç SQL Queries & Insights

#1. TOTAL SALES BY COUNTRY --

`SELECT COUNTRY, SUM(SALES) AS TOTAL_SALES FROM `auto sales data` GROUP BY COUNTRY ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES DESC;`


#2. #2. TOP 5 CUSTOMERS BY REVENUE
`SELECT  CUSTOMERNAME, ROUND(SUM(SALES),2) AS TOTAL_SPENT FROM  `auto sales data` GROUP BY CUSTOMERNAME ORDER BY TOTAL_SPENT DESC LIMIT 5;`

#3 AVERAGE ORDER VALUES 
`SELECT ROUND(AVG(SALES),0) AS AOV FROM `auto sales data` ;`

#4. PRODUCT PERFORMANCE BY PRODUCTLINE
`SELECT 
ROUND(AVG(SALES),2) AS AVG_SALES,
ROUND(SUM(SALES),2) AS TOTAL_SALES,
COUNT(*) AS TOTAL_ORDERS 
FROM 
`auto sales data` GROUP BY PRODUCTLINE
ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES DESC;`

#5. YEARLY REVENUE AND ORDER VOLUME
`SELECT 
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM STR_TO_DATE(ORDERDATE, '%d/%m/%Y')) AS ORDER_YEAR,
  SUM(SALES) AS TOTAL_REVENUE,
  COUNT(DISTINCT ORDERNUMBER) AS TOTAL_ORDERS
FROM `auto sales data`
WHERE ORDERDATE IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY ORDER_YEAR
ORDER BY ORDER_YEAR;`

#6. REVENUE DIFF BETWEEN DEALSIZES
`SELECT DEALSIZE, 
COUNT(*) AS TOTAL_ORDERS, ROUND(SUM(SALES),1) AS TOTAL_SALE
FROM `auto sales data`
GROUP BY DEALSIZE 
ORDER BY TOTAL_SALE DESC;`

#7. FIND DUPLICATE CUSTOMER NAME
`SELECT CUSTOMERNAME, COUNT(*) AS COUNT FROM `auto sales data` GROUP BY CUSTOMERNAME HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;`

#8. LIST OF PRODUCTS WITH BELOW AVERAGE MSRP
`SELECT PRODUCTLINE, PRODUCTCODE, MSRP FROM `auto sales data` WHERE MSRP > (SELECT AVG(MSRP)
 FROM `auto sales data`);`

 #9. COUNT OF ORDERS BY STATUS
`SELECT STATUS, COUNT(*) AS TOTAL_ORDER FROM `auto sales data` GROUP BY STATUS ORDER BY TOTAL_ORDER;`

#10. TOP 3 MONTHS BY SALES
`SELECT 
 EXTRACT(YEAR FROM STR_TO_DATE(ORDERDATE, '%d/%m/%Y')) AS ORDER_YEAR,
 EXTRACT(MONTH FROM STR_TO_DATE(ORDERDATE, '%d/%m/%y')) AS ORDER_MONTH,
 ROUND(SUM(SALES),2) AS TOTAL_REVENUE
 FROM `auto sales data` GROUP BY ORDER_YEAR, ORDER_MONTH ORDER BY TOTAL_REVENUE DESC
 LIMIT 3;`

#11. DEAL WITH MISSING VALUE
`SELECT ROUND(SUM(COALESCE(SALES, 0)),2) AS TOTAL_SALES FROM `auto sales data` ;`
